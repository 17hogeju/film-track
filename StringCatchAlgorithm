#Comment: 
#Let's assume that the prefix function has been obtained, that is, we don't care about how the prefix function is calculated. Then when we already have a way to get the prefix function, the next step is to match the pattern P.

#Line 6 calls the function longest_prefix_suffix to calculate the prefix function of mode P. 
#Line 8 begins to scan the text T sequentially, and note that the variable q records the number of characters that successfully match the pattern P at this moment. 
#When the next character fails to match (P[q+1]!=T[i]), the value of q is recalculated according to the prefix function, such as the two lines of code 9 and 10. 
#The value of q is simply incremented by 1 when a match is successful. In the last 13 lines, when the value of q (the number of characters already matched) is equal to the length of the pattern P, we have found a matching string.
