# FilmTrack
FilmTrack is a mobile application that helps you prioritize what to watch next based off of your TV and Film interests and your budget.

## Abstract
FilmTrack provides a simple system for keeping track of the shows and movies you have watched and want to watch while also providing suggestions on what to watch next based on your preferences. It utilizes machine learning to recommend shows and movies that other similar users liked. Based on what you have watched, are watching, want to watch, might want to watch, and monthly budget, FilmTrack suggests which streaming platforms to use that will give you the best viewing options each month.
