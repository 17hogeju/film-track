## Media data collection
Media data is sourced from the title.basics.tsv dataset from IMDb. Information about which platforms these titles are available on are found on the website, Reelgood. Titles that can be found in both places are included in the dataset and everything else is excluded. This data collection and cleanup is being done in a separate repository, FilmTrackModel, on GitHub.
