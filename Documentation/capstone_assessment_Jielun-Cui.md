The name of this project is FilmTrack. It is a mobile application that helps the user prioritize what to watch next based on the usersâ€™ TV 
and Film interests and your budget. The reason I choose this project as my senior design is that I am a big fan of movies and I really want
to improve our experience of selecting movies before going to the cinema. To achieve our goal of developing such an application, we will mainly 
use the technology of machine learning and some other assistant skills. Since we have three members who are all Computer Science Senior, we will
probably make it due to our four-year programming experience.

Looking back to my college curriculum, it can be divided into three parts. First part is the introductory stage of learning to program. 
In this part, I learned fundamental C++ programming(CS 1021C) and Engineering design thinking(ENED 1100 & ENED 1120), which includes matlab,
labview and python. Second part is the advanced step of deely study in programming. During this period, I have learned Python programming(CS 2021),
Data Structure(CS 2028C), Intro to computer systems(CS 2011), Discrete Structure(CS 2071) and Programming Language(CS 3003). The third part is
application of the previous courses. In this part, I learned Software Engineering(EECE 3093), Database Design(CS 4092), Algorithm(CS 4071), 
AI applications(CS 4033) and Computer Networking(CS 4065). Because of gradually learning CS related knowledge, I became more and more familiar
with this area and found it interesting during this process.

Besides the courses, the co-op experience also inspires me a lot. In my first co-op, I was playing the role of web designer. During that period,
I found it amazing when my code was converted into a beautiful website. In the second one, because of Covid-19, I chose to do EEP on compass.
In that period, I learned a lot about cybersecurity. In the last two co-op, I did projects in a lab and really learned a lot about IOT and Spyder programming.

I am motivated to participate in the project because it is an application based on what I have learned instead of an academic research.
Also, as I mentioned before, I was a big fan of movies. When I was looking for  a new movie to watch, I always felt confused with the 
selection of movies. In another word, the softwares /applications are not always considerate about which movies the users are really fond of. 
Therefore, when I saw the title of this project, I was very interested in the idea.

My preliminary approach to designing a solution is to make a model of the application and also make a detailed plan on how to develop it step by step. 
My expected process is gradually like this: Make a plan of the whole development process -> Make a good model of our app -> Apply our technology 
as an engine on the app -> Check if there is something that we can improve -> Complete the whole work.
And the expected process should be a perfect app that can help the users prioritize what to watch next based on your TV and Film interests 
and their budget. The accomplishment should be similar to the expected result but with a perfect report added. 
The way we evaluate our contribution should be: Our team will set up a peer rate system to make sure that everyone is performing well in senior design.
