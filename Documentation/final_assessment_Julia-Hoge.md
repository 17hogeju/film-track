**What was your individual contribution to this project?**
As the project leader, I conceived the idea and established the requirements for the FilmTrack app. I also took on the role of organizer, coordinating the efforts of the team. In addition, I was responsible for creating the machine learning model, designing the app's user interface and user experience, and acting as the lead developer to ensure the project's success.


**Did you apply and build upon the skills identified in your initial assessment from last Fall?**
I believe I  successfully applied and built upon the skills identified in my initial assessment from last fall. Over the course of the project, I enhanced my technical skills by creating and using a Firebase database, developing API scripts to process and clean media data, and writing and debugging code in Flutter/Dart. My organization skills also improved as I applied Agile methodologies to tackle planning, execution, and evaluation of our progress. Additionally, I expanded my UI design skill set by transitioning from Adobe XD to Figma, which  shows my ability to  adapt and my  commitment to continuous learning.


**What did you do and how did you do it?**
I defined the requirements for the project, determined the minimum viable product, and outlined the steps needed to achieve it. Then, I assigned tasks to team members based on their skills, broke down the project into manageable parts, and utilized time estimation techniques to ensure progress remained on track. I also developed the supervised learning recommendation algorithm, designed the user interface by creating Figma wireframes, and set up the development environment to implement FilmTrack’s major features.


**What did you learn and what competencies did you build?**
I learned how to become a better product manager by enhancing my skills in communication, prioritization, strategic thinking, and collaboration. I also improved my ability to stay on task by defining a weekly goal, implementing what was needed to achieve that goal, and reflecting on areas for improvement during weekends to ensure I didn't get sidetracked by optimization. Moreover, I found that identifying tasks not to work on helped me to determine which tasks I needed to focus on. Additionally, I gained knowledge about various NLP models, as well as the processes of cleaning, storing, and handling big data. Furthermore, I discovered that designing wireframe components can help visualize how to separate code into logical modules.


**What were your successes, what were your obstacles?**
My successes included setting up the backend and ensuring that the major features worked smoothly. Additionally, the recommendation algorithm functioned as I expected, meeting my goal for providing relevant suggestions.

I encountered several obstacles over the course of this project. I had initially planned to use GCP for data processing, but it proved to be cost-ineffective due to the large dataset. Additionally, the limited initial data for the supervised learning model negatively affected the recommendation quality. However, most of the obstacles stemmed from time constraints within the two-semester project timeline. This led to cutting out smaller features, such as removing list items, considering the user’s budget, and modifying user account information. Time constraints also forced me to scale back recommendation engine features, like data separation by genres and adding a dislike option. Lastly, insufficient time to gather external user feedback limited my ability to make data-driven adjustments.
