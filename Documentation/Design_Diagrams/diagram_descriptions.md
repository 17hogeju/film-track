# Design Diagrams
**Diagram Conventions:**
- Arrows denote the direction of information flow
- Rectangles denote algorithms
- Left leaning parallelograms denote inputs
- Right leaning parallelograms denote outputs
- Ovals with points denote displays
- Cylinders denote stored data

## Level 0
![](https://github.com/17hogeju/film-track/blob/main/Documentation/Design_Diagrams/FilmTrack_D0.jpg)

**Description:** In the level 0 diagram, the overall data flow is depicted in the form of inputs and outputs

**Input:** A user's media data (media seen, media they want to see, media they dislike) and current subscriptions

**Output:** recommendations for new media and subscriptions are output.

## Level 1

**Description:** In the level 1 diagram, the overall data flow is depicted in addition to major sections of the app

**To-Watch Section:** Includes a screen to keep track of user's media they want to watch. User can also input media here.

**Watched Section:** Includes a screen to keep track of user's media they have already seen. User can also input and rate media here.

**Recommendation Section:** Includes a screen that a user can view their personal recommendations on. The recommendations are generated by an ML algorithm that learns the user's interests from the media they want to see and have already seen.

**Subscription Section:** Includes a screen that a user can input and view their current media subscriptions as well as their budget. It also displays a 'best combination of subscriptions' for the user based on their interests and budget.

## Level 2

**Description:** In the level 2 diagram, the overall data flow, major sections of the app, and essential algorithm flow are depicted

**Search Section:** Includes a search bar which the user can enter either media they would like to see or media they have already seen. This search query is parsed and displays a list of potential matches from the media collection in the DB.

**To-Watch List Section:** From the search results screen, a user can add media to their to-watch list. Their choice is added to the DB and is used to train the ML algorithm to learn the user's interests. A user can modify, delete, and view items in their to-watch list.

**Watched List Section:** From the search results screen, a user can add media to their watched list and must give it a rating. This media is also added to the DB and is used to train the ML algorithm to learn the user's interests. A user can modify, delete, and view items in their watched list.

**Recommendation Section:** Based on the user's watched and to-watch lists, the ML algorithm uses similar user data to find and display recommended media that the user might be interested in. The user can add those recommendations to their to-watch list or add them to their watched list with a rating. The user can also give feedback on the quality of the recommendations.

**Subscription Section:** Based on the user's watched and to-watch lists in addition to the user's current subscriptions, an algorithm determines which subscriptions the user should keep and which subscriptions a user might want to consider. This is displayed in a 'Best Combination of Subscriptions' screen.
