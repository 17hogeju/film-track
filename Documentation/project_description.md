## Project Topic Area
FilmTrack is a mobile application that helps you track your media interests, discover new media, and identify which subscription services are right for you.

## Problem Statement
In today's world, there are countless streaming services vying for our attention, each offering a vast selection of TV shows and movies to choose from. From Netflix to Disney+, it's easy to get lost in the sea of options and lose track of what you've watched, what you want to watch, and what you might enjoy. With the high cost of subscription services, it's frustrating to pay for multiple platforms and end up underutilizing them. There needs to be a better way to discover and track your media interests so that you don’t waste money on underutilized streaming services.

## FilmTrack's Solution
FilmTrack provides a simple system for tracking your media interests and identifying which streaming services align most with your media preferences. It utilizes machine learning to recommend titles based on your media collection’s metadata and media that similar users enjoyed.
