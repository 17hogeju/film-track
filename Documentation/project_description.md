## Project Topic Area
FilmTrack is a mobile application that helps you prioritize what to watch next based off of your TV and Film interests and your budget.

## Problem Statement
This is the era of endless entertainment! There are so many streaming services with different tv shows and movies to watch in addition to box office films. It can be hard to keep track of which shows/movies you have watched, want to watch, are waiting for the next episode or season to watch, or may like but have never heard of. You can spend hours watching seasons of a show only to forget about it completely by the time new episodes are released again. When you sit down to relax with a show or a film, you should be able to easily pick out something without feeling like you are missing out on other, better shows or films that you also wanted to watch but can’t remember off the top of your head. It can also be very expensive to pay for multiple streaming services only to end up not utilizing all of them. There needs to be a better way to find and keep track of what media you want to watch so that you don’t waste money on underutilized services.

## FilmTrack's Solution
FilmTrack provides a simple system for keeping track of the shows and movies you have watched and want to watch while also providing suggestions on what to watch next based on your preferences. It utilizes machine learning to recommend shows and movies that other similar users liked. Based on what you have watched, are watching, want to watch, might want to watch, and monthly budget, FilmTrack suggests which streaming platforms to use that will give you the best viewing options each month.
