# Budget

Our project uses the free version of Firebase. The No-cost Spark plan includes:
- 10K phone authentications per month
- 50K monthly active users
- 1 GiB of stored data in Firestore
- 20K document writes per day
- 50K document reads per day
- 20K deletes per day
- Custom Firebase ML model deployment
- 1 GB of realtime Database storage

We also use Flutter, an open source framework by Google for building natively compiled, multi-platform applications. 

To gather our media data, we are parsing a subset of IMDb data which is available for personal and non-commercial use.

Therefore we do not have any expenses for this project.
