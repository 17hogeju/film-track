# Getting Started

## Overview

FilmTrack provides a simple system for keeping track of the shows/movies you have watched and want to watch while also providing suggestions on what to watch next based on your preferences.

## Navigating the FilmTrack app

In order to use the app, a user must have an account. Upon opening the app, a screen will prompt the user to sign in with a username and password. If the user has not created an account yet, they can follow the link on the sign-in page to register.

To register an account, a user must input a valid email and a password. After registration, the user will have to sign in with their given credentials to get to the home screen.

From the home screen, the user can search for movies/shows, and navigate to their settings, watched list, and to watch list.
The home button on the bottom navigation menu will always navigate back to this screen.

When the user types a media title in the search bar, they can add the desired result to their watched (star icon) or to-watch (pin icon) list. In order to add a title to the watched list, users must give the title a rating (out of five).

Once the user has added 5 movie titles or 5 tv titles to their watched or to-watch lists, they are able to get recommendations. The recommendation screen can be accessed through the recommendations button on the bottom navigation menu.

On the recommendations screen, 10 titles will display in a carousel view: 5 movie and 5 tv show recommendations. The suggestions are based off of the user's movie and tv show interests added to the lists. The user can swipe through the recommendations and view the poster, short description, and genres of the suggested titles. They can add the title to their watched list (star icon) and give it a rating, add the title to their to-watch list (pin icon), or dislike the recommendation. 

Movie recommendations refresh after the user has added 5 more movies to either list. Similarly, adding 5 more tv shows to either list refreshes the tv show recommendations.

When the user navigates to their watched list from the home screen, they will see a list of the media that they have seen along with their ratings for each title. They can edit their rating (press the star icon for a rating pop-up) or remove a title (trash icon) from their list.

When the user navigates to their to-watch list from the home screen, they will see a list of the media that they have saved. This list is for movies and shows that the user wants to watch and hasn't seen. They can either remove items from this list (trash icon), or add the movie to their watched list (press the star icon for a rating pop-up) and rate it.

When the user navigates to their settings from the home screen, they can view/edit their email and password, sign out, or delete their account.

The subscription screen can be accessed through the subscriptions button on the bottom navigation menu. On this screen, users can view 3 recommendations based off of their watched list and 3 recommendations based off of their to-watch list. These suggestions update when the recommendations update (After 5 movies or 5 tv shows are added to any lists).

## FAQ

**How many movies and tv shows are available on this app?**
FilmTrack uses the most popular 5000 movie and 5000 tv show titles. More titles are pulled monthly to keep up with new films/shows.
Titles are also updated monthly for changes in platforms availability.

**What if I can't find a title?**
Make sure you enter the movie/show title exactly as it is known for. If this is done and the title still does not appear in the search results, make a request to hogejr@mail.uc.edu to make the title available on FilmTrack.

**Do disliked recommendations influence the new recommendations?**
Yes, disliked titles will affect your suggested movies and tv shows. However, disliked recommendations do not count towards the 5 movie/ 5 show threshold that will update your current recommendations.
