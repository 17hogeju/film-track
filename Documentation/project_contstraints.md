# Project Design Constraints

## Diversity and Cultural:

There are cultural constraints that will impact our application - because there are time and cost constraints on our project as a whole/how we get our media data, our application will be targeted towards North America. As of now we plan to support English as the only language for our app, as well as prioritizing the population of our database with the most popular media from North America.
Ultimately, promoting diversity in our application will not just increase the number of potential users for our app but also the user experience. With more users and media outside of North America, our application could recommend more media/subscriptions that users may not have considered - for example, our users may discover that they immensely enjoy bollywood/anime because they share other favorited media with users outside of North America.

## Economic Constraints:

Our project has a few economic constraints. As students we cannot afford to spend money on building a highly scalable backend with low latency, so we have to use services with minimal to no cost upfront, especially for development purposes. This also places a restriction on how many concurrent users we can have. In addition, we will need to work with free APIs to gather information about media for our solution. Some of those free APIs have rate limitations that we will have to consider while designing our solution. Our project has an ML component as well and deploying those ML models on a personal device that feeds into the interface for our users would impact user experience due to high latency, so we need to host our custom ML models on the cloud, however, we cannot put any advanced services such as model drift monitoring around it, as those, would be quite expensive.

## Legal Constraints:
Our project also has several legal constraints. Three main constraints are confidentiality agreements, intellectual property rights and end-user License Agreement. To protect our app ideas in legal ways from potential stealing or competition, it is necessary to sign a confidentiality agreement. However, obviously, we cannot sign such an agreement so it means our idea of the project may be stolen or misused. Also, intellectual property plays an important role in developing a legal app. During the app development process, our team will be creating legal app ideas, original content, logo, designs, source code, app names, etc. Thirdly, the major app stores require apps on their platform to have an end-user license agreement. Currently, it is unsure that if we need to upload this app to the app store but the EULA should be considered.

## Ethical Constraints:
Ethics constraints are also important constraints in our project. Since the project is based on a senior design, it is not commercial. Compared with the private-sector firms, our app are beholden to the public interest. For example, other public-sector media and BBC have explored using recommendation systems as both a way to compete with private-sector competitors and to meet more effectively with their public service projections. But there still are lack of research into the ethics of recommendation systems used in these contexts, and since then a lack of clear guidance for how public-sector organizations should consider designing and implementing such systems. Due to the previous reasons, our project still have some problem on overcome the ethics constraints.
