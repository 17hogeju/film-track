Within this project, I primarily worked on the recommendations screen – this involved not only implementing the UI that Julia designed but also the logic behind adding an item to the To Watch list, adding an item to the Watched list, removing items from the screen, and refresh logic when the list quota was met. This was all done in using Flutter (open-source UI software development kit) and Dart (programming language). It involved lots of research, as I had not done any development with Flutter or Dart leading up to this project. Not only did I have to learn more about those technologies but I also had to learn about mobile app development as a whole.

I did end up applying and building upon the skills I identified in my initial assessment and reached the goals that I had set. My number one success would be my work on the recommendations screen – by the end of the project, I was writing code that lined up with Flutter’s best practices. My biggest obstacle was my unfamiliarity with Flutter and mobile app development – I was not sure about how to organize my code in a neat fashion and I was not very familiar with mobile app development.
