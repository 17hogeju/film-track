My main contribution to this project is the design of the string-catch algorithm. The skills I identified for my initial assessment last fall were the following: Python 
programming, firebase programming, flutter programming, and machine learning. Ultimately I applied and built on the skills identified in the initial assessment last fall.

I mainly designed the algorithm and the background of the application. In this process, I learned three programming methods and related codes, which mainly cultivated
learning ability and organizational ability. My greatest success has been improving my programming skills and my ability to learn new technologies. My biggest hurdle 
is the initial challenges and difficulties of learning something new.
